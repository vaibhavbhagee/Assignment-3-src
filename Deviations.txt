(A) Deviations in existing classes
	-class Rectangle
	 The class was originally meant to render all rectangles on the board, including the paddles. Later, the shape of the paddles were changed to arcs, and the class' draw functions were updated to render arc-shaped paddles as well. Several functions were added to make the code in remaining classes more readable, including functions meant for paddles only, other objects on the screen etc.
	-class BlankArea
	 Several functions were added to manipulate the various types of rectangles, paddles, balls, string which were being displayed on the screen. Some functions like reDraw were added to improve the running of the code
(B) New Classes Added
	-Start, MultiOpt, StartLoad, EnterIP, JoinLoad
	 These new classes are used for displaying intermediate screens and miscellaneous stuff.

******************

(A) In the design doc we had mentioned that the Socket handler class will wait for incoming connections and spawn a new thread of the individual connection handler
	class which will manage the further communication. However in the actual implementation, the individual connection handler is not a thread but only a simple object having the
	functionality of sending the messages to the peer to which it belongs. Spawning a new thread was not deemed necessary here as for a particular peer, a single thread namely the 
	socket_handler() thread could handle the receiving of messages sent out to that peer.

(B) In the design doc we had mentioned that the socket_handler() class would contain a function called ping_all_clients() which will check a peer disconnectiona and reconnection. However
	in the actual implementation, we have created a class connectivity_check() which extends the TimerTask class of java. This provided us the advantage of checking for disconnection and reconnection 
	of a peer in the run() method of the class. So, this timer runs in parallel to the socket_handler thread and reports any disconnection or reconnection of peers to the socket_handler thread.
	Thus disconnection and reconnection can be considered independent of socket handling. This class also provides us the advantage that if the packet containing the message or disconnection or 
	reconnection of a peer gets lost for some other peer, we are actually pinging a connected list to all the connected peers who can add a client in case they don't have its details with them
	if it is connected.
