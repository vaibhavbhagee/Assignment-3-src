TODO List

** 1) Keep an option to pause the game in single player (don’t call update :P )
3) Display Reconnected and disconnected - not sure whether done or not
5) Waiting for user list - I think ion has done this
** 6) Setting the AI level…. I have improved the AI! :D
7) In case of joining an invalid IP (Abhi null hai Abhi null hai) we should be able to tell the user it’s a bad IP.
8) Magnetic collisions??? Kya hae??
9) Ion, you can display the number of lives left on the board itself. It is easier to view it there and idea bhai lagta hai how many lives of the opponent are left.

LINE 270 of MouseClickBla class mein CHANGE THE TRAIL WALA SPEED!!!

ADD anything else in the list as and when you see things
** wale important hain
